Euclidean Description Guidelines
1. Event Type and Activities:

2. Audience and Participation:

Objective: Clarify the intended audience and participation level.
Details to Include: Indicate whether the event is suitable for beginners, professionals, or a general audience. Mention if active participation is required or if it's more of a passive experience.

3. Practical Arrangements:

Objective: Provide information on what attendees should bring, what will be provided, and any special arrangements.
Details to Include: Specify if participants need to bring their own materials, if refreshments will be provided, and any dress code or physical preparation required. For example, "Attendees are advised to bring their own yoga mats and wear comfortable clothing. Light snacks and beverages will be provided."

7. Child-Friendly and Special Accommodations:

Objective: Note if the event is child-friendly or if there are any special accommodations for attendees with specific needs.
